URL-REWRITE - Rewrite (X)HTML attributes with Common Lisp
---------------------------------------------------------

URL-REWRITE is a small package which can be used to programmatically
rewrite (X)HTML documents such that certain attributes values are
replaced by others. It was written to rewrite URLs (as in <code>&lt;a
href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;img
src=&quot;...&quot;&gt;</code>) for cookie-less session handling but
maybe you'll find other uses for it.

Complete documentation for URL-REWRITE can be found in the `docs`
directory or at the [project site](https://edicl.github.io/url-rewrite/).
